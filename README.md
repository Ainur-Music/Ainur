Ainur is an innovative deep learning model for conditional multimodal music generation. It is designed to generate high-quality stereo music samples at 48 kHz conditioned on a variety of inputs, such as lyrics, text descriptors, and other audio. Ainur's hierarchical diffusion architecture, combined with CLASP embeddings, allows it to produce coherent and expressive music compositions across a wide range of genres and styles.

## Features

- **Conditional Generation:** Ainur enables the generation of music conditioned on lyrics, text descriptors, or other audio, offering a flexible and creative approach to music composition.

- **High-Quality Output:** The model is capable of producing 22-second stereo music samples at 48 kHz, ensuring high fidelity and realism.

- **Multimodal Learning:** Ainur employs CLASP embeddings, which are multimodal representations of lyrics and audio, to facilitate the alignment of textual lyrics with corresponding audio fragments.

- **Objective Evaluation:** We provide comprehensive evaluation metrics, including Frechet Audio Distance (FAD) and CLASP Cycle Consistency (C3), to assess the quality and coherence of generated music.

## Requirements

To run Ainur, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 1.13.1
- PyTorch Lightning 2.0.0

You can install the required Python packages by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ainur-music/ainur.git
cd ainur
```
2. Install the dependencies (as mentioned above).
3. Run Ainur with your desired input. Check out the example notebooks in the `examples` folder for guidance on using Ainur for music generation. (*coming soon*)
